Ventilator Assistant - Clinical Decision Support Tool
Ventilator Assistant Screenshot

Overview
The Ventilator Assistant is a web-based application designed to support clinical decision-making for mechanical ventilation management. This tool provides real-time feedback on ventilator settings, patient-specific recommendations, and visual waveform displays similar to those found on ICU ventilators.

Features
Core Functionality
Patient Data Input: Weight-based tidal volume calculation with condition-specific adjustments

Ventilator Settings Panel: Editable parameters for all major ventilation variables

Real-time Monitoring: Displays key ventilation parameters with safety alerts

Clinical Decision Support: Provides condition-specific recommendations (ARDS, COPD, etc.)

Visual Waveforms: Dynamic display of pressure, flow, and volume waveforms

Technical Features
Responsive design works on desktop and tablet devices

Dark/light mode toggle for different clinical environments

Interactive charts with simulated real-time updates

Bootstrap 5 framework for modern UI components

Chart.js for dynamic waveform visualization
